          <p>
            Before being colonised by the British in the 17th century, Barbados was home to the
            indigenous Carib and Arawak communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arrival of the British in the 17th century sparked the beginning of the island's
            transformation into a major slave colony in the sugar industry. In 1966 Barbados
            achieved full independence from the United Kingdom. Today, the rich history has shaped
            the island's unique culture making it an ideal travel destination for all.

          <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
          <p>That's easy, anywhere.</p>
          <p>
            Barbados is full of beautiful beaches at every corner of the island. Be it the west
            coast, east coast or south coast.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're looking to enjoy a laid back "feet up on the beach" kind of experience then
            the south coast is the place for you! This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accra Beach Hotel</li>
            <li>Radisson Aquatica Resort</li>
            <li>Courtyard by Mariott</li>
            <li>and many others!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But if you're coming to surf then there's no better coast to stay than on the east
            coast.
          </p>
          <p>To experience the east side of the island you can stay at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Crane Resort</li>
            <li>Wyndham Grand Barbados All Inclusive Resort</li>

          <h2>What and Where to Eat</h2>
          <p>Being an island, it's no surprise that seafood is one of Barbados' specialties.</p>
          <p>
            Whether it's shrimp, lobster, or a variety of fish like flying fish, barracuda, or mahi
            mahi (to name just a few!), there's something for both seafood lovers and skeptics
            alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, seafood isn’t the only delight Barbados has to offer. The local cuisine is a
            blend of Caribbean, African, Italian and British flavours creating an enjoyable culinary
            experience for all. There are many beachfront restaurants that offer stunning ocean
            views and often feature live music. Whether you’re in the mood for a casual lunch or an
            upscale dinner, Barbados offers a variety of options for every dining occasion.
